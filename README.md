# Singularity Archive

Welcome to the Singularity Archive! Here is where you can find all past versions of our docs, and if we need other things in the future, those things too.

## Documentation
These are the documentation bases that correspond with initial releases of the Singularity software. Each of them is available as a branch on the [main docs repository](https://www.github.com/singularityware/singularityware.github.io) if the content needs to be re-rendered or generated for any reason.

 - [Documentation Singularity v2.2](docs/v2-2): Version 2.2 of Singularity includes everything at the release of 2.2 and before it. At this release point, Singularity Hub and Docker `pull` was not implemented, nor was `inspect` [release](https://github.com/singularityware/singularityware.github.io/releases/tag/2.2).
 - [Documentation Singularity v2.3](docs/v2-3): Version 2.3 has added `pull`, `inspect`, and a more flexible metadata folder for actions, labels, and runscripts [release](https://github.com/singularityware/singularityware.github.io/releases/tag/2.3).
